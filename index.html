						<p id="mission_statement_text">Children within our communities are hungry and consuming unhealthy foods at an alarming
                 rate. Some of the time it is just a matter of parents being overworked and too exhausted to prepare the meals. Yet, more often than not low-income families struggle to make ends meet resulting in harsh decisions such as; keep a roof over our heads or limit the family's food intake. FamilyBonds is dedicated to networking with agencies and parents to make sure the low-income families within our communities always have food in their cabinets and children do not go hungry. We are also dedicated to teaching children how to cook exclusively in the microwave to help lighten the burden of tired, exhausted working parents while working to strengthen family bonds.
